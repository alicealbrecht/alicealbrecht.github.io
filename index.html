              <p>
                I care a lot about how we can use machines to augment human thought. 
                I think that information is powerful, and with the right information we can make better decisions and be more creative.

                I've worn many hats over the years as a researcher, academic, and entrepreneur.
                Currently, I'm at SmartNews with a bunch of other smart people, working on how AI can 
                help people access quality news while honoring their attention and the journalists who create it.
